# SORTING VISUALIZER
  ### This is the minor project that I have done in my 7th Semester.
- The Sorting Visualizer is an interactive web-based tool that allows users to see sorting algorithms in action. It provides a hands-on experience for understanding how different sorting algorithms work.
- The Sorting Visualizer is created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Data Structures and Algorithms, where HTML provides structure, CSS offers styling, JavaScript handles interactive functionality, and DSA contributes the logic for sorting algorithms.
- Sorting algorithms are step-by-step procedures used to arrange elements in a specific order, typically based on numerical or lexicographic criteria.
- The web application represents data in the form of a bar graph and the Sorting Visualizer features adjustable parameters such as array size and animation speed, allowing users to experiment with different scenarios and witness algorithmic behaviour in varying contexts. It becomes a valuable tool for debugging and performance analysis, ensuring the selection of the most suitable algorithm for specific datasets and improving overall application efficiency.
